## 📝 Description

A GitHub Action to scan virus (including malicious file and malware) in the GitHub Action workspace.

### 🛡 Anti Virus Software

- **[ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net):** Made by [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com), is an open source anti virus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malwares, and other malicious threats.
  - [Unofficial Signatures List][clamav-unofficial-signatures-list]
- **[YARA](http://virustotal.github.io/yara):** Made by [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com), is a tool aimed at but not limited to help malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples.
  - [Rules List][yara-rules-list]

### ⚠ Disclaimer

This action does not provide any guarantee that carefully hidden objects will be scanned. Strong endpoint security, access, and code review policies and practices are the most effective way to ensure that malicious files and/or codes are not introduced. False positives maybe also will be happened.

### 🌟 Feature

- 4\~96% faster than other GitHub Actions with the same purpose, especially when need to scan every Git commits.
- Ability to scan other things, not limited to only Git repository.
- Files filter to scan specify directories and/or files or not.

#### `input_tableparser`

`<String = "yaml">` Paser to use when input is type of table:

- `csv`
  ```csv
  bar,foo
  5,10
  10,20
  ```
- `csv-kv-singleline`
  ```
  bar=5,foo=10;bar=10,foo=20
  ```
- `csv-kv-multipleline`
  ```

    foo: 10
  - bar: 10
    foo: 20
  ```

#### `targets`

`<Uri[]>` Targets.

- **Local *(Default)*:** Workspace, for prepared files to the workspace (e.g.: checkout repository via [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout)) in the same job before this action.
- **Network:** Fetch files from network to the workspace, by HTTP/HTTPS URI, separate each target by [list delimiter (input `input_listdelimiter`)](#input_listdelimiter); Require a clean workspace.

When this input is defined (i.e.: network targets), will ignore inputs:

- [`git_integrate`](#git_integrate)
- [`git_ignores`](#git_ignores)
- [`git_reverse`](#git_reverse)

#### `git_integrate`

`<Boolean = False>` Integrate with Git to scan every commits; Require workspace is a Git repository.

When this input is `False`, will ignore inputs:

- [`git_ignores`](#git_ignores)
- [`git_reverse`](#git_reverse)

#### `git_ignores`

[`<Table<{String:RegEx}>>`](#input_tableparser) Git ignores (for commits), by table.

Available properties (i.e.: keys) with type of key is string (`<String>`) and type of value is regular expression (`<RegEx>`) (commits' information are provided by [Git CLI `git log`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log), but only these properties are supported):

- `AuthorDate` (ISO8601 UTC (end with `Z`))
- `AuthorEmail`
- `AuthorName`
- `Body`

- `GPGSignatureTrustLevel`
- `Notes`
- `ReflogIdentityEmail`
- `ReflogIdentityName`
- `ReflogSelector`
- `ReflogSubject`
- `ShortenedReflogSelector`
- `Subject`
- `TreeHash`

Example:

```yml
- AuthorName: ^octokit$
  CommitterName: ^octokit$
```

#### `git_reverse`

`<Boolean = False>` Reverse scan order of the Git commits.

- **`False`:** From the oldest commit to the newest commit.
- **`True`:** From the newest commit to the oldest commit.

#### `clamav_enable`

`<Boolean = True>` Use ClamAV.

When this input is `False`, will ignore inputs:

- [`clamav_daemon`](#clamav_daemon)
- [`clamav_ignores`](#clamav_ignores)
- [`clamav_multiscan`](#clamav_multiscan)
- [`clamav_reloadpersession`](#clamav_reloadpersession)
- [`clamav_subcursive`](#clamav_subcursive)
- [`clamav_unofficialsignatures`](#clamav_unofficialsignatures)

#### `clamav_daemon`

`<Boolean = True>` Use ClamAV daemon.

When this input is `False`, will ignore inputs:

- [`clamav_multiscan`](#clamav_multiscan)
- [`clamav_reloadpersession`](#clamav_reloadpersession)

> **⚠ Important:**
>
> - It is recommended to keep this as enable to have a shorter scanning duration.
> - When this input is `False`, will have limitations to protect the system against DoS attacks:
>   - Extract and scan at most 25 MB from each archive.
>   - Extract and scan at most 100 MB from each scanned file.
>   - Extract at most 10000 files from each scanned file (when this is an archive, a document or another kind of container).
>   - Maximum 15 depth directories are scanned.
>   - Maximum 16 archive recursion levels.

#### `clamav_ignores`

[`<Table<{String:RegEx}>>`](#input_tableparser) ClamAV ignores (for files, sessions, and/or signatures), by table with type of key is string (`<String>`) and type of value is regular expression (`<RegEx>`).

Available properties (i.e.: keys):

- `Path` (Relative path based at GitHub Action workspace without `./` (e.g.: Path`/`To`/`File`.`Extension))
- `Session` (`Current`, Git commit hash, or HTTP/HTTPS URI)
- `Signature` (Platform`.`Category`.`Name`-`SignatureID`-`Revision)

Example:

```yml
- Path: ^node_modules
```

> **⚠ Important:**
>
> - If this acts weird, try to disable input [`clamav_subcursive`](#clamav_subcursive) first before report the issues!
> - It is not recommended to use this on the ClamAV official signatures due to these rarely have false positives in most cases.
> - ClamAV unofficial signatures maybe not follow the recommended signatures name pattern.

#### `clamav_multiscan`

`<Boolean = True>` Use ClamAV multiscan mode; ClamAV daemon will attempt to scan in parallel using available threads, especially useful on multiprocessor and multi-core systems.

> **⚠ Important:** It is recommended to keep this as enable to have a shorter scanning duration.

#### `clamav_reloadpersession`

`<Boolean = False>` Reload ClamAV per session.

> **⚠ Important:** It is recommended to keep this as disable to have a shorter scanning duration.

#### `clamav_subcursive`

`<Boolean = True>` Scan directories subcursively.

> **⚠ Important:** If input [`clamav_ignores`](#clamav_ignores) acts weird, try to disable this first before report the issues!

#### `clamav_unofficialsignatures`

`<RegEx[]>` Use ClamAV unofficial signatures, by regular expression and [ClamAV unofficial signatures list][clamav-unofficial-signatures-list], separate each signature with [list delimiter (input `input_listdelimiter`)](#input_listdelimiter); By default, all of the unofficial signatures are not in use.

> **⚠ Important:** It is not recommended to use this due to ClamAV unofficial signatures have more false positives than official signatures in most cases.

#### `yara_enable`

`<Boolean = False>` Use YARA.

When this input is `False`, will ignore inputs:

- [`yara_ignores`](#yara_ignores)
- [`yara_rules`](#yara_rules)
- [`yara_toolwarning`](#yara_toolwarning)

> **⚠ Important:** It is not recommended to use this due to YARA rules can have many false positives in most cases.

#### `yara_ignores`

[`<Table<{String:RegEx}>>`](#input_tableparser) YARA ignores (for files, rules, and/or sessions), by table with type of key is string (`<String>`) and type of value is regular expression (`<RegEx>`).

Available properties (i.e.: keys):

- `Path` (Relative path based at GitHub Action workspace without `./` (e.g.: Path`/`To`/`File`.`Extension))
- `Rule` (Index`/`RuleName)
- `Session` (`Current`, Git commit hash, or HTTP/HTTPS URI)

Example:

```yml
- Path: ^node_modules
```

#### `yara_rules`

`<RegEx[]>` Use YARA rules, by regular expression and [YARA rules list][yara-rules-list], separate each rule by [list delimiter (input `input_listdelimiter`)](#input_listdelimiter); By default, all of the rules are not in use.

#### `yara_toolwarning`

`<Boolean = False>` Enable YARA tool warning.

> **⚠ Important:** It is recommended to keep this as disable due to YARA rules can have many warnings about deprecated features, while client does not need these informations in most cases.

#### `update_assets`

`<Boolean = True>` Update ClamAV unofficial signatures index, ClamAV unofficial signatures, YARA rules index, and YARA rules from [assets repository][assets-repository] before scan anything.

> **⚠ Important:**
>
> - When inputs [`clamav_unofficialsignatures`](#clamav_unofficialsignatures) and [`yara_rules`](#yara_rules) are not defined, will skip this update in order to save some times.
> - It is recommended to keep this as enable to have the latest assets.
> - If this action have issues during updates, switch this to disable for offline mode.

#### `update_clamav`

`<Boolean = True>` Update ClamAV via FreshClam (e.g.: ClamAV official signatures) before scan anything.

> **⚠ Important:**
>
> - When input [`clamav_enable`](#clamav_enable) is `False`, will skip this update in order to save some times.
> - It is recommended to keep this as enable to have the latest ClamAV official signatures.
> - If this action have issues during updates, switch this to disable for offline mode.
