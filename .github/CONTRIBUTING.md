# Contributing

## Preface

This contributing guide includes the guidelines, methods, and ways to contribute on different categories, items, and types; If this contributing guide does not include some of the categories, items, and/or types, maybe:

- those guidelines, methods, and/or ways are separated from this contributing guide and exist and/or store in their corresponding places,
- those categories, items, and/or types are easy to understand how to correctly contributing, or
- maintainers and/or owners forgot to edit this contributing guide.

If you still confused, try to create a discussion or an issue.

## Discussions

- Before create a discussion, check whether any similar discussions are already exist.

## Issues

- Before create an issue, check whether any similar issues are already exist.

## Pull Requests

- Before create a pull request, check whether any similar pull requests are already exist.
- Always create a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.
- Try to avoid merge conflicts if possible.
- Try to avoid a pull request with too many changes if possible.
  - A large pull request not only stretches the review time, but also makes it much harder to spot issues.
  - It is better to split the pull request to multiple smaller ones.
- If your pull request is not ready but want to save it first, you can submit it by mark as draft, and no need to add any identifications to the title (e.g.: `WIP`).
